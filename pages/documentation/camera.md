## Dependencies

This has no particular dependencies, but it may require knowledge of all the cameras in the scene

## Description

The Camera Switching system allows Jeff to switch camera views- generally a list of cameras available in the scene is kept and referenced when the camera view needs to be switched, and updated when a new camera is discovered.

This article will be further fleshed out once the system is more fleshed out and more details are provided
