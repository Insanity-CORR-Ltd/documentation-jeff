## Dependencies

Needs some sort of procedural mesh system in place that allows a spine system to dictate the curvature of the belt. Additionally, the ability to place ends of the belt.

The system must create any given number of middle sections of the mesh along a specific path, update those meshes in a reasonable and optimal time frame, and then be used by the engine's collision system to determine how to move objects that interact with it.

## Description

A free-form conveyor belt, complete with tool that allows us to create them procedurally.

## Architecture

The following are concepts that must be implemented for the conveyor to function properly:

### Speed

The speed of the belt

### IsOn

Determines if the belt is allowed to move. Useful for puzzles, allowing belts to be treated as toggleable devices.

### Spine

The class that dictates the path the belt takes. This should act as a wrapper for the 'spline' class, as well as any other mathematically defined curves.

### Distances

A list of the distance along the spine where each vertex lies. Used in calculating where approximately an object on the belt is relative to the spine.

### Passengers

A list of all objects currently lying on the belt. This is updated after each physics update, to confirm whether these objects are still on/off the belt.

### Belt Offset

A number (modulo 1) that corresponds to how far the belt has 'moved', as well as dictating how far to offset the texture of the belt.
