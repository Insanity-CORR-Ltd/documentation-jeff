## About Jeff-3

In Headless Jeff-3, you play as the titular robot Jeff-3! Navigate your clumsy body through the eyes of your detached head. Overcome head-twisting obstacles, and solve complex puzzles as you stumble along in your quest to escape the abandoned Industrial Megacenter in this action-packed '2nd-person perspective' adventure! The steam page can be found [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1721820/Headless_JEFF3/).

The Technical Design Document you are currently reading serves as a guide for other developers to modify, extend, or interface with the existing systems of Jeff-3. We also outline planned features and systems which have not yet been implemented to communicate gameplay specifications and ensure they are met.
